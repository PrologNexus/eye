Expressing knowledge as implications with disjunction in the conclusion.

This is giving us FOL expressivity in N3 so that we have proofs in N3.

[[
More generally, we define clauses and their interpre tation as follows.
A clause is an expression of the form 
B1, ... , Bm <- A1, ... , An    m, n 2>=0, 
where B1, ... , Bm, A1, ... , An are atoms. The atoms A1, ... , An are
conditions of the clause and the atoms B1, ... , Bm are alternative
conclusions of the clause.
If the clause contains the variables x1, ... , xk then interpret it as
stating  that 
for all x1, ... , xk
B1 or ... or Bm if A1 and ... and An.
