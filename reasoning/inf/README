Implication Normal Form - INF
-----------------------------

Expressing knowledge as implications with disjunction in the conclusion.

This is giving us FOL expressivity in N3 so that we have proofs in N3.


ChatGPT says:

Implication Normal Form (INF) is a specific way of structuring logical 
expressions such that implications are the main connective. In this 
form, logical statements are expressed using implications (→), 
conjunctions (∧), and disjunctions (∨), without using negations 
directly on compound statements.

A formula is in Implication Normal Form if it adheres to the following 
rules:

1/ Atomic Propositions: Atomic propositions (variables) and their 
   negations are allowed.
2/ Implications as Main Connective: The main logical connective in the 
   formula is an implication.
3/ Subformulas: The antecedent (left side of the implication) can be a 
   conjunction of propositions, and the consequent (right side of the 
   implication) can be a disjunction of propositions.
