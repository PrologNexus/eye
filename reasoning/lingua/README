Lingua

Lingua supports reasoning with forward rules described in RDF as
```
_:ng1 lingua:implication _:ng2.

_:ng1 {
    RDF triples
}

_:ng2 {
    RDF triples
}
```

A forward rule with `lingua:implication false` is an inference fuse.

Lingua also supports reasoning with backward rules described in RDF as
```
_:ng1 lingua:component _:ng2.

_:ng1 {
    RDF triples
}

_:ng2 {
    RDF triples
}
```

Lingua also supports querying with queries described in RDF as
```
_:ng1 lingua:query _:ng2.

_:ng1 {
    RDF triples
}

_:ng2 {
    RDF triples
}
```

The `lingua:` prefix is `<http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/lingua#>` and is rooted
in the "Semantic Web Area for Play" `http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/` URI.

The `var:` prefix is `<http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/var#>` and is used for
variables that are interpreted as universally quantified variables except for
forward rule conclusion-only variables which are interpreted existentially.

Literal subjects are described as
```
[] rdf:value "aha"; :p :o.
```
