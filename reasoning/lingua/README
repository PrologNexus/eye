RDF lingua is a web dialogical language used for governed knowledge exchange.
It is using the W3C RDF TriG 1.1 REC to describe:

1/ implications (aka forward rules)

    _:bng_1 log:implies _:bng_2.

    _:bng_1 {
        RDF triples
    }

    _:bng_2 {
        RDF triples
    }

2/ components (aka backward rules)

    _:bng_1 log:isImpliedBy _:bng_2.

    _:bng_1 {
        RDF triple
    }

    _:bng_2 {
        RDF triples
    }

3/ queries (aka filter rules)

    _:bng_1 log:query _:bng_2.

    _:bng_1 {
        RDF triples
    }

    _:bng_2 {
        RDF triples
    }

The var: prefix is <http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/var#> and is used for
variables that are interpreted as universally quantified variables except for
forward rule conclusion-only variables which are interpreted as existentially
quantified variables.

Inference fuses are expressed as implications implying false

    _:bng_1 log:implies false.

    _:bng_1 {
        RDF triples
    }

Literal subjects are described as

    [] rdf:value "aha"; :p :o.

Self reference throws a term_cannot_contain_itself/2 exception.
