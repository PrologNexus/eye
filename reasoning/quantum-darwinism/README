Quantum Darwinism
-----------------

Quantum Darwinism is a theory proposing that the classical world 
emerges from the quantum world through a natural selection-like 
process, where certain quantum states proliferate by imprinting 
themselves redundantly into the environment, making them observable
and objective.
