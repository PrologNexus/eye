and https://github.com/w3c-cg/rdfsurfaces

What we currently use is a N3 sublanguage to express RDF(-star) Surfaces.
A negative surface containing a query surface is treated as a backward rule.
See for instance https://github.com/eyereasoner/eye/blob/master/reasoning/blogic/complex.n3

RDF(-star) Surfaces is in a sense all we need and we even have
coherent logic http://www.ii.uib.no/acl/description.pdf like in the example
