Coherent Logic - CL
-------------------

See http://www.ii.uib.no/acl/description.pdf
[[
CL extends Horn clause logic (on which the programming language Prolog
is based) and resolution logic in that we may have a whole disjunction
of existentially quantified conjunctions of atoms in the conclusion.
