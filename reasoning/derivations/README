Derivations

(1) Infinite fact derivations are backward rules aka user defined built-ins
    e.g.

    # see https://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/doc/tutorial-1.pdf page 17
    # something is more interesting if it is greater
    {
        ?x :moreInterestingThan ?y.
    } <= {
        ?x math:greaterThan ?y.
    }.


(2) Partial evaluation derivations are rules with rules in the conclusion
    e.g.

    # partial evaluation of subclass
    {
        ?A rdfs:subClassOf ?B.
    } => {
        {
            ?X a ?B.
        } <= {
            ?X a ?A.
        }
    }.


(3) Possible conclusion derivations are forward rules with a set of possible conclusions
    e.g.

    # all cars are green or blue
    {
        ?A a :Car.
    } => ($
        {
            ?A :is :green.
        }
        {
            ?A :is :blue.
        }
    $).

    # negation
    {
        ?A a :Car.
        ?A a :Horse.
    } => ($ $).
