Gehl graphs expressing Horn logic
---------------------------------

Gehl graphs express Horn logic in RDF as follows:

- facts

    RDF triples

- implications

    _:bng_1 log:implies _:bng_2.

    _:bng_1 {
        RDF triples
    }

    _:bng_2 {
        RDF triples
    }

- components

    _:bng_1 log:isImpliedBy _:bng_2.

    _:bng_1 {
        RDF triple
    }

    _:bng_2 {
        RDF triples
    }

- queries

    _:bng_1 log:query _:bng_2.

    _:bng_1 {
        RDF triples
    }

    _:bng_2 {
        RDF triples
    }


The _:bng_i are called blank node graphs.

A forward rule with log:implies false is an inference fuse.

The var: prefix is <http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/var#> and is used for
variables that are interpreted as universally quantified variables except for
forward rule conclusion-only variables which are interpreted as existentially
quantified variables.

Literal subjects are described as

    [] rdf:value "aha"; :p :o.
