# Each predicate in RDF represents a binary relation, i.e. a set of 2-tuples.
# For each of those relations you can formulate exactly one complementary
# relation, which contains exactly the pairs of elements that are not in the
# original set (from this follows LEM). If we represent the relationship
# between these complements by a predicate, e.g. log:complement, then we
# can express the following in pure RDF
#
# NOT {
#    _:s1 :p1 _:o1.
#    _:s2 :p2 _:o2.
#    _:s3 :p3 _:o3.
# }
