Zero-Knowledge Proof for Graph 3-Coloring
Alice wants to prove to Bob that she knows a valid 3-coloring of a graph without revealing the actual colors.
A 3-coloring means assigning one of three colors to each vertex so that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.
Bob can verify that the proof is correct without learning the actual coloring.
