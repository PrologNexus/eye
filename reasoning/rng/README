RDF N3 Graphs - RNG
-------------------

RNG supports reasoning with forward rules described in RDF as e.g.

    # subclass rule
    [ log:premis
        <<( var:A rdfs:subClassOf var:B )>> ,
        <<( var:S rdf:type var:A )>> ;
      log:forwardConclusion
        <<( var:S rdf:type var:B )>>
    ].

RNG supports reasoning with backward rules described in RDF as e.g.

    # is the age of a person above some duration?
    [ log:backwardConclusion
        <<( var:S :ageAbove var:A )>> ;
      log:premise
        <<( var:S :birthDay var:B )>> ,
        <<( var:D log:equalTo "2024-08-21T00:00:00.0Z"^^xsd:dateTime )>> ,
        <<( (var:D var:B) math:difference var:F )>> ,
        <<( var:F math:greaterThan var:A )>>
    ].

RNG supports querying with queries described in RDF as e.g.

    # query
    [ log:premise
        <<( var:S :ageAbove "P80Y"^^xsd:duration )>> ;
      log:queryConclusion
        <<( var:S :ageAbove "P80Y"^^xsd:duration )>>
    ].

The var: prefix is <http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/var#> and is used for
variables that are interpreted as universally quantified variables except for
forward rule conclusion-only variables which are interpreted existentially.

Literal subjects are described as

    [] rdf:value "aha"; :p :o.
