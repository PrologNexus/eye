1/ implications (aka forward rules)

    (
        RDF 3-tuples
    ) holog:implies (
        RDF 3-tuples
    ).

2/ components (aka backward rules)

    (
        RDF 3-tuple
    ) holog:isImpliedBy (
        RDF 3-tuples
    ).

3/ queries (aka filter rules)

    (
        RDF 3-tuples
    ) holog:query (
        RDF 3-tuples
    ).

The var: prefix is <http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/var#> and is used for
variables that are interpreted as universally quantified variables except for
forward rule conclusion-only variables which are interpreted as existentially
quantified variables.

Inference fuses are expressed as implications implying false

    (
        RDF 3-tuples
    ) holog:implies false.

Literal subjects are described as

    [] rdf:value "aha"; :p :o.
