The top level surface is an implicit positive surface with implicit graffiti.

log:not is a negative surface to express:

- negation:
    (graffiti) log:not (log:and spoterms).

- disjunction:
    (graffiti) log:not (log:and spoterms that are all like (graffiti) log:not (log:and spoterms)).

- implication:
    (graffiti) log:not (log:and spoterms containing a (graffiti) log:not (log:and spoterms)).

- component:
    (graffiti) log:not (log:and spoterms containing a (graffiti) log:not (log:component spoterm)).

- query:
    (graffiti) log:not (log:and spoterms containing a (graffiti) log:not (log:answer spoterms)).
