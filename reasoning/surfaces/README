The top level surface is an implicit positive surface with implicit graffiti.

log:not is a negative surface to express:

- negation:
    (graffiti) log:not (log:and spo-terms).

- disjunction:
    (graffiti) log:not (log:and spo-terms only containing (graffiti) log:not (log:and spo-terms)).

- implication:
    (graffiti) log:not (log:and spo-terms containing a (graffiti) log:not (log:and spo-terms)).

- component:
    (graffiti) log:not (log:and spo-terms containing a (graffiti) log:not (log:component spo-term)).

- query:
    (graffiti) log:not (log:and spo-terms containing a (graffiti) log:not (log:answer spo-terms)).
