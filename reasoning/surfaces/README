log:nand is a negative surface used to express NAND based logic:
- nand (not and) is a log:nand surface
- negation is a log:nand surface
- disjunction is a log:nand surface containing only log:nand surfaces
- => is a log:nand surface containing a log:nand surface
- <= is a log:nandB surface containing a log:nandB surface

log:nandQ is a query surface containing a log:nandQ answer surface.
