The top level surface is an implicit positive surface with implicit graffiti.

log:not is a negative surface to express:

- negation:
    graffiti log:not (log:and 3-terms).

- disjunction:
    graffiti log:not (log:and log:not 3-terms).

- implication:
    graffiti log:not (log:and 3-terms containing a graffiti log:not (log:and 3-term)).

- component:
    graffiti log:not (log:and 3-terms containing a graffiti log:not (log:component 3-term)).

- query:
