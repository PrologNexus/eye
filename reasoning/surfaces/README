The top level surface is an implicit positive surface with implicit graffiti.

A negative surface is expressed as
    (graffiti) log:onNegativeSurface (log:and spo*).

which is classical negation with the following special cases:

    - disjunction: all spo are
        (graffiti) log:onNegativeSurface (log:and spo*)

    - implication: some spo are
        (graffiti) log:onNegativeSurface (log:and spo*)

    - component: one spo is
        (graffiti) log:onNegativeComponentSurface (log:and spo)

    - query: one spo is
        (graffiti) log:onNegativeAnswerSurface (log:and spo*)

A query surface is expressed as
    (graffiti) log:onQuerySurface (log:and spo*).
