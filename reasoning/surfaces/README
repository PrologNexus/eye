The top level surface is an implicit positive surface with implicit graffiti.

A negative surface is expressed as (graffiti) log:onNegativeSurface (log:and spo-items).
- disjunction: all spo-terms are (graffiti) log:onNegativeSurface (log:and spo-items)
- implication: some spo-terms are (graffiti) log:onNegativeSurface (log:and spo-items)
- component: one spo-term is (graffiti) log:onNegativeComponentSurface (log:and spo-item)
- query: one spo-term is (graffiti) log:onNegativeAnswerSurface (log:and spo-items)

A query surface is expressed as (graffiti) log:onQuerySurface (log:and spo-items).
