Boxes

Infinite fact boxes are backward rules aka user defined built-ins
e.g. https://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/doc/tutorial-1.pdf page 17

# something is more interesting if it is greater
{
    ?x :moreInterestingThan ?y.
} <= {
    ?x math:greaterThan ?y.
}.


Sequent boxes are forward rules with a set of possible conclusions
like explained in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequent e.g.

# all cars are green or blue
{
    ?A a :Car.
} => ($
    {
        ?A :is :green.
    }
    {
        ?A :is :blue.
    }
$).

# negation
{
    ?A a :Car.
    ?A a :Horse.
} => ($ $).
