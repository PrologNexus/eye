log:nand examples
-----------------

The log:nand built-in implements https://w3c-cg.github.io/rdfsurfaces/
- a positive surface is a log:nand with just a single embedded log:nand
- a question surface is a log:nand with an embedded log:output
- a neutral surface is a log:nand with an embedded empty log:nand

Of course, log:nand can be used as a logic building block
- negation is a just log:nand
- implication is a log:nand with an embedded log:nand
- impliedBy is a log:nand with an embedded log:not
- disjunction is a log:nand with multiple embedded log:nand's
