NAND

Expressing nand as { triples } => false.

We define NAND logic in nand.n3 similarly to how we define other logic 
systems, such as RDFS, OWL, Fuzzy Logic, etc. This approach serves two 
main purposes: first, to enable the generation of valid proofs, and 
second, to facilitate the selection of rules and queries for subsequent 
reasoning processes.

The tests are from Patric Hochstenbach.
