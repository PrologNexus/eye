NAND
----

Expressing nand as { triples } => false.

We express the intended NAND logic explicitly in nand.n3 just like we do for instance for RDFS, OWL, Fuzzy logic, ...
The exception is RDF Surfaces where we embedded those rules inside the reasoner and we should take them out again.
First to make valid proofs and second to be able to use reasoning to select rules and queries for other reasoning runs.

The tests are from Patric Hochstenbach.
