NAND
----

Expressing nand as { triples } => false.

We express the NAND logic in nand.n3 just like we do for instance for
RDFS, OWL, Fuzzy logic, ... The exception is RDF Surfaces where we 
embedded those rules inside the reasoner and we should take them out
again: first to make valid proofs and second to be able to use
reasoning to select rules and queries for other reasoning runs.

The tests are from Patric Hochstenbach.
