Expressing knowledge as implications with disjunction in the conclusion.
This is giving us FOL expressivity in N3 so that we have proofs in N3.

See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequent

Examples:
--------
# all cars are green or blue
{
    ?A a :Car.
} => ({
    ?A :is :green.
} {
    ?A :is :blue.
}).

# negation
{
    ?A a :Car.
    ?A a :Horse.
} => ().
