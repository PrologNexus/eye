The top level surface is an implicit positive surface with implicit graffiti.

log:onNegativeSurface is a negative surface used to express NAND based logic:
- negation is a log:onNegativeSurface
- disjunction is a log:onNegativeSurface containing only log:onNegativeSurface's
- implication is a log:onNegativeSurface containing a log:onNegativeSurface
- infinitefactbox is a log:onNegativeSurface containing a log:onNegativeComponentSurface (not anode)
- query is a log:onNegativeSurface containing a log:onNegativeAnswerSurface (not answer)
