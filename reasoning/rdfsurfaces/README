log:nand is a negative surface used to express NAND based logic:
- negation is a log:nand
- disjunction is a log:nand containing only log:nand's
- forward implication is a log:nand containing a log:nand
- backward implication is a log:nand containing a log:nano
- query is a log:nand containing a log:nans
