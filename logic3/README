(1) Infinite fact boxes are backward rules aka user defined built-ins
    e.g.

        # see https://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/doc/tutorial-1.pdf page 17
        # something is more interesting if it is greater
        {
            ?x :moreInterestingThan ?y.
        } <= {
            ?x math:greaterThan ?y.
        }.


(2) Negations are implications with no possible conclusion (empty set)
    e.g.

        # it is impossible that something is a car and a horse
        {
            ?A a :Car.
            ?A a :Horse.
        } => ($ $).


(3) Sequents are forward rules with sets of possible conclusions
    e.g.

        # all cars are green or blue
        {
            ?A a :Car.
        } => ($ {
            ?A :is :green.
        } {
            ?A :is :blue.
        } $).
