Teacher: Let us discuss Pythagorean theorem. To begin, what do you already know about it?
Student: I believe let is important because It states that in a right‑angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse equals the sum of the squares of the other two sides.

Teacher: Why do you think believe?
Student: I believe why is important because The theorem can be written as *c² = a² + b²* where c is the length of the hypotenuse.

Teacher: What evidence supports your statement about c?
Student: I believe what is important because It only holds for Euclidean geometry; on curved surfaces the relationship changes.

Teacher: Can you reconcile believe with what?
Student: I believe can is important because One intuitive proof uses shear transformations to show that area is preserved.

Teacher: Can you reconcile believe with can?
Student: I believe can is important because There are reputedly hundreds of proofs, including one attributed to President Garfield.

Teacher: What underlying assumptions lead you to focus on believe?
Student: I believe what is important because Empirical evidence as well as logical reasoning both play roles in understanding it.

Teacher (closing): You have reflected on several aspects of the topic.
                 Consider how these ideas might apply in practice as your next inquiry.
