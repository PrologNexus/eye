Logic with RDF Surfaces
-----------------------

See https://w3c-cg.github.io/rdfsurfaces/

The top level surface is an implicit positive surface with implicit graffiti.

log:onPositiveSurface is a positive surface.

log:onNegativeSurface is a negative surface used to express NAND based logic:
- negation is a log:onNegativeSurface
- implication is a log:onNegativeSurface containing a log:onNegativeSurface
- if is a log:onNegativeSurface containing a log:onNegativeSurface of a triple term
- disjunction is a log:onNegativeSurface containing only log:onNegativeSurface's.

log:onQuerySurface is a query surface.

log:onQuestionSurface is a question surface containing a log:onAnswerSurface.

log:onNeutralSurface is a neutral surface.
