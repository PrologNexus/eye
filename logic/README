Logic with RDF Surfaces
-----------------------

See https://w3c-cg.github.io/rdfsurfaces/

The top level surface is an implicit positive surface with implicit graffiti.

log:onNegativeSurface is a negative surface used to express anything in logic:
- a negation is just a log:onNegativeSurface
- a positive surface is a log:onNegativeSurface of a log:onNegativeSurface
- an implication is a log:onNegativeSurface with an embedded log:onNegativeSurface
- an impliedBy is a log:onNegativeSurface with an embedded log:onNegativeSurface of a triple term
- a disjunction is a log:onNegativeSurface with just embedded log:onNegativeSurface's
- a query is a log:onNegativeSurface with an embedded log:onAnswerSurface

log:onQuerySurface is a query surface.

log:onNeutralSurface is a neutral surface.
