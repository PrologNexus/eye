Logic with RDF Surfaces
-----------------------

The top level surface is an implicit positive surface with implicit graffiti.

log:onNegativeSurface is a negative surface used to express anything in logic:
- negation is just a log:onNegativeSurface
- implication is a log:onNegativeSurface with an embedded log:onNegativeSurface
- impliedBy is a log:onNegativeSurface with an embedded log:negativeTriple
- disjunction is a log:onNegativeSurface with just embedded log:onNegativeSurface's

log:onNeutralSurface is a neutral surface.

log:onQuerySurface is a query surface.
log:onQuestionSurface is a query surface with an embedded log:onAnswerSurface.
