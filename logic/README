See https://w3c-cg.github.io/rdfsurfaces/

The top level surface is an implicit positive surface with implicit graffiti.

log:onPositiveSurface is a positive surface.

log:onNegativeSurface is a negative surface used to express NAND based logic:
- nand (not and) is a log:onNegativeSurface
- negation is a log:onNegativeSurface
- disjunction is a log:onNegativeSurface containing only log:onNegativeSurface's
- => is a log:onNegativeSurface containing a log:onNegativeSurface
- <= is a log:onNegativeSurface containing a log:onNegativeSurface of a triple term

log:onQuerySurface is a query surface.

log:onQuestionSurface is a question surface containing a log:onAnswerSurface.

log:onNeutralSurface is a neutral surface.
