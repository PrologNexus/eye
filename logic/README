---------------------------------------------
Logic: RDF Surfaces implemented with log:nand
---------------------------------------------

log:nand is a logic building block and a built-in just like log:implies
- negation is a just log:nand
- implication is a log:nand with an embedded log:nand
- impliedBy is a log:nand with an embedded log:nand of a triple term
- disjunction is a log:nand with multiple embedded log:nand's

log:nand implements https://w3c-cg.github.io/rdfsurfaces/
- a positive surface is a log:nand with just a single embedded log:nand
- a question surface is a log:nand with an embedded log:output
- a neutral surface is a log:nand with an embedded empty log:nand
