Logic: RDF Surfaces implemented with log:surface, log:nand and log:output
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

log:surface is a neutral surface packaging all kinds of RDF surfaces.
Using explicit accompanying log:nand based logic it can serve any purpose,
from detecting policy violations to guaranteeing the quality of the data.

log:nand is a negative surface used to express anything in logic:
- negation is just a log:nand
- implication is a log:nand with an embedded log:nand
- impliedBy is a log:nand with an embedded log:nand of a triple term
- disjunction is a log:nand with multiple embedded log:nand's

log:output is used within log:nand to output the answer to a query.

The top level is an implicit positive surface with implicit graffiti.


P.S.
log:surface is the origin from which things evolve using log:nand and
all this can be observed with log:output driving dialogical reasoning.
