----------------------------------------------
Logic: RDF Surfaces implemented with log:nands
----------------------------------------------

log:nands is a logic building block and a built-in just like log:implies
- negation is a just log:nands
- implication is a log:nands with an embedded log:nands
- impliedBy is a log:nands with an embedded log:nands of a triple term
- disjunction is a log:nands with multiple embedded log:nands's

log:nands implements https://w3c-cg.github.io/rdfsurfaces/
- a positive surface is a log:nands with just a single embedded log:nands
- a question surface is a log:nands with an embedded log:output
- a neutral surface is a log:nands with an embedded empty log:nands
