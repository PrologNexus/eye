The top level surface is an implicit positive surface with implicit graffiti.

log:onPositiveSurface is a positive surface.

log:onNegativeSurface is a negative surface used to express anything in logic:
- a negation is just a log:onNegativeSurface
- an implication is a log:onNegativeSurface with an embedded log:onNegativeSurface
- an impliedBy is a log:onNegativeSurface with an embedded log:onNegativeSurface of a triple term
- a disjunction is a log:onNegativeSurface with just embedded log:onNegativeSurface's

log:onQuerySurface is a query surface.

log:onQuestionSurface is a question surface with an embedded log:onAnswerSurface.

log:onNeutralSurface is a neutral surface.
