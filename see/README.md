# Second Eye of Euler - SEE

- Looking at the [eye/reasoning](https://github.com/eyereasoner/eye/tree/master/reasoning) cases from a [standard prolog](https://www.scryer.pl/) perspective
- Using web predicates `'your_iri'/n` as dialogical lingua (*)
- Using [sequents](https://github.com/eyereasoner/eye/blob/master/see/beetle6.pl) to express First Order Logic

(*) Literally speaking it is a language that is used for dialogs on the web. More specifically it is meant to achieve socratic completeness. The socratic completeness idea guarantees that for any fact which is a logical consequence of the assumed theories, there is a series of preliminary queries and assumptions after which a query of the fact will succeed.
