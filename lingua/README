RDF Lingua
----------

RDF as the web talking language.

Lingua supports reasoning with rules described in RDF as
    :rulename a lingua:ForwardRule.
    :rulename a lingua:BackwardRule.
    :rulename lingua:premis _:premisename.
    :rulename lingua:conclusion _:conclusionname.

    _:premisename {
        RDF triples
    }

    _:conclusionname {
        RDF triples
    }

and is able to give proof explanations as
    :rulename lingua:bindings list of (var:name value) pairs.

Lingua also supports querying with queries described in RDF as
    :queryname a lingua:Query.
    :queryname lingua:question _:questionname.
    :queryname lingua:answer _:answername.

    _:questionname {
        RDF triples
    }

    _:answername {
        RDF triples
    }

and is able to give proof explanations as
    :queryname lingua:bindings list of (var:name value) pairs.

A query without lingua:answer will answer with bound lingua:question.

The lingua: prefix is <http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/lingua#> and is rooted
in the "Semantic Web Area for Play" http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/ URI.

The var: prefix is <http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/var#> and is used for
variables that are interpreted as universally quantified variables except for
forward rule conclusion-only variables which are interpreted existentially.
