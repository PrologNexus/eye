RDF Core as the web talking language.

Reasoning with rules described in RDF:
- rule name a lingua:ForwardRule, lingua:BackwardRule or lingua:QueryRule
- rule name lingua:premise which is a list of subject predicate object items
- rule name lingua:conclusion which is a list of subject predicate object items

and able to give proof explanations on top of the query answers:
- rule name lingua:bindings list of var:name value substitutions

The range of lingua:premise and lingua:conclusion are lists like
    (lingua:conjunction
        :s1 :p1 :o1
        :s2 :p2 :o2
        ...
    )
so lists with a first element lingua:conjunction and a rest of 3 element triples.
Same for any other conjunction of triples.

The lingua: prefix is <http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/lingua#> which is rooted
in the "Semantic Web Area for Play" uri http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/

The var: prefix is <http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/var#> and is used for variables
which are interpreted as universally quantified variables with a scope of the rule
in which they occur.
