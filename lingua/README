Reasoning with rules described in RDF as
- rulename a ruleType
- rulename lingua:premise conjunctionList
- rulename lingua:conclusion conjunctionList

and able to give proof explanations as
- rulename lingua:bindings substitutionList

A ruleType is one of lingua:ForwardRule, lingua:BackwardRule or lingua:QueryRule.

A conjunctionList is a list with lingua:conjunction as first element and with
a rest composed of zero or more subject predicate object 3 element triples.

A substitutionList is a list of (var:name value) pairs.

The lingua: prefix is <http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/lingua#> which is rooted
in the "Semantic Web Area for Play" uri http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/

The var: prefix is <http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/var#> and is used for variables
which are interpreted as universally quantified variables with a scope of the rule
in which they occur.
