RDF Lingua

RDF as the web lingua.

Lingua supports reasoning with forward rules described in RDF as
    :rulename
        lingua:premis _:premisename;
        lingua:conclusion _:conclusionname.
    _:premisename
        log:closedBy <>.
    _:conclusionname
        log:closedBy <>.

    _:premisename {
        RDF triples
    }

    _:conclusionname {
        RDF triples
    }

and is able to give proof explanations as
    :rulename lingua:bindings list of (var:name value) pairs.

A forward rule with lingua:conclusion true is an immediate goal.
A forward rule with lingua:conclusion false is an inference fuse.

Lingua also supports reasoning with backward rules described in RDF as
    :rulename
        lingua:head _:headname;
        lingua:body _:bodyname.
    _:headname
        log:closedBy <>.
    _:bodyname
        log:closedBy <>.

    _:headname {
        RDF triples
    }

    _:bodyname {
        RDF triples
    }

and is able to give proof explanations as
    :rulename lingua:bindings list of (var:name value) pairs.

Lingua also supports querying with queries described in RDF as
    :queryname
        lingua:question _:questionname;
        lingua:answer _:answername.
    _:questionname
        log:closedBy <>.
    _:answername
        log:closedBy <>.

    _:questionname {
        RDF triples
    }

    _:answername {
        RDF triples
    }

and is able to give proof explanations as
    :queryname lingua:bindings list of (var:name value) pairs.

When lingua:answer is omitted it is the repetition of lingua:question.

The lingua: prefix is <http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/lingua#> and is rooted
in the "Semantic Web Area for Play" http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/ URI.

The var: prefix is <http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/var#> and is used for
variables that are interpreted as universally quantified variables except for
forward rule conclusion-only variables which are interpreted existentially.

TriG and N-Quads input can reasoned and queried with
    _:graphname lingua:graph var:G.
