and able to give proof explanations as

The lingua: prefix is <http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/lingua#> and is rooted
in the "Semantic Web Area for Play" http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/ URI.

The var: prefix is <http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/var#> and is used for
variables that are interpreted as universally quantified variables except for
forward rule conclusion-only variables which are interpreted existentially.
