## delta

- queries use an upwards double arrow `=^` as shorthand for `log:query`
- backward rules use a leftwards double arrow `<=` as shorthand for `log:isImpliedBy`
- forward rules use a rightwards double arrow `=>` as shorthand for `log:implies`

## variables

- only `_:x` blank nodes in triples and quads
- only `?x` quickvars in rules and queries
- quantified `var:x` variables in proofs
